//! The peephole optimizer, which replaces common loop forms with single (non-Brainfuck)
//! instructions.
//!
//! In `bfi`, this is the default final pass if the JIT was not enabled at compile time
//! (with `--features=jit`). If the JIT is present, the peephole optimizer can be selected as
//! the final path with the `--peep` flag.
//!
//! For example, we detect the pattern `[-]`, which decrements the current byte until it reaches
//! zero, and replaces it with the [`SetZero`](../../src/bf/peephole/mod.rs.html#21-22)
//! instruction. See the [`common::Instruction`](../common/enum.Instruction.html) enum for a list of
//! the instructions produced by the [peephole compiler](fn.compile.html).
