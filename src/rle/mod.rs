//! Run-length encodes Brainfuck commands.
//!
//! In `bfi` by default, this pass runs after parsing and before peephole optimization. To run
//! the output from run-length encoding directly and skip peephole optimization, pass the `--rle`
//! flag.
//!
//! This module takes an [unoptimized Brainfuck AST](../ast/index.html) and replaces repeated runs
//! of the same command with a run-length encoded instruction.
