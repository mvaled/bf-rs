//! Parsing and interpretation for unoptimized Brainfuck abstract syntax trees.
//!
//! In `bfi` by default, this pass runs before run-length encoding and peephole optimization. To
//! run the unoptimized AST directly and skip all optimization, pass `--ast` flag.
//!
//! In this module, BF programs are represented by the [`Program`](type.Program.html)
//! type, which is an array of [`Instruction`](enum.Instruction.html)s. `Instruction`s
//! correspond directly to Brainfuck commands, except that loops are represented as subtrees
//! rather than with begin and end markers.
